    <h1>Project Euler</h1>
    <p>Leonhard Euler was a great mathematician. His introductory book into algebra could be very easily used today by young and old alike to learn more about the building blocks of mathematics,
      that is, the building blocks of our modern world.</p>
    <p>To honor the man, somebody tought of naming a mathematical puzzle-solving game by him. So we have Project Euler.</p>
    <p>Project Euler is a great idea. I encourage everybody to take a look at these fun mind puzzles and have fun solving them. <br> more on https://projecteuler.net/ </p>
