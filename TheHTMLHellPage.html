    <dt class="c4"><blink>blinking text</blink></dt>
    <dd>Blinking text makes it nearly impossible to pay attention to
anything else on the page. It reduces 87% of all surfers to a helpless
state of fixated brain-lock, much like that of a rabbit caught in the
headlights of an oncoming semi. This is not good. If you abuse the
blink tag, you deserve to be shot. <i>Clue:</i> if you <b>use</b> the
blink tag, you're abusing it. (<cite>User Friendly</cite> has an <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20030427&amp;mode=classic">apposite
comment</a> on this.)</dd>

    <dd>With animations you get all the wonderful injuries of the
blink tag with the added insult of the graphics download time.
People who abuse these should have flip books rammed into every
bodily orifice until they figure out that a two- or three-frame
graphics loop is even less pleasant than <i>that</i>.</dd>

    <dd>The very next time we stumble across a page composed by
    somebody who thinks it's cool to use leaping flames or a big moire
    pattern or seven shades of hot pink swirly as a background, we
    swear we are going to reach right through the screen and rip out
    that festering puke's throat. If there's a worse promoter of
    eyestrain and migraines than the blink tag, this is it.</dd>
