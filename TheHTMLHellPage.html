    <dd>Blinking text makes it nearly impossible to pay attention to
anything else on the page. It reduces 87% of all surfers to a helpless
state of fixated brain-lock, much like that of a rabbit caught in the
headlights of an oncoming semi. This is not good. If you abuse the
blink tag, you deserve to be shot. <i>Clue:</i> if you <b>use</b> the
blink tag, you're abusing it. (<cite>User Friendly</cite> has an <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20030427&amp;mode=classic">apposite
